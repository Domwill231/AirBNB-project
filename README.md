# AirBNB-project
The following analysis is to determine which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive
for vacation rentals and how much money did they generate. 
Through the data cleaning process, we were able to determine that Chelsea ,East Harlem, East Village, 
Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, Lower East Side, Midtown, Upper East Side, 
Upper West Side, and West Village were the most desired neighborhoods. 
Also, we gathered that 1 bedrooms were the most desired in all of the neighborhoods except for Harlem. 
Studios were more desired in Harlem. 
Lastly, we were able to see how much each property would generate over a 12 month span. 
Investing in 1 bedroom properties in these neighborhoods will continue to generate profit. 
Properties that causes profit loss can be sold to the general public.
