# AirBNB-Project
The objective of this analysis is to identify the neighborhoods and property sizes that are most appealing 
for vacation rentals, along with their corresponding revenue generation. Through a comprehensive data cleaning
process, we identified the following neighborhoods as the most sought after for vacation rentals: Chelsea, 
East Harlem, East Village, Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, Lower East Side, Midtown, Upper East Side, Upper West Side, and West Village. 
Our findings indicate that one-bedroom properties are the most preferred across these neighborhoods, with the exception of Harlem, 
where studio apartments are more desirable.Additionally, we assessed the potential revenue each property type could generate
over a 12-month period. The data suggests that investing in one-bedroom properties within these high-demand neighborhoods is 
likely to yield consistent profits. Conversely, properties that demonstrate a potential for profit loss may be considered for sale
to the general public to optimize the investment portfolio.
